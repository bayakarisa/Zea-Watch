        "description": "Common rust, caused by the fungus *Puccinia sorghi*, manifests as small, circular to elongated, cinnamon-brown pustules that erupt on both the upper and lower surfaces of maize leaves. These pustules contain powdery, rust-colored spores that can give the leaf a rough, sandpaper-like feel. While the provided image shows very early or mild symptoms as tiny yellowish specks, a more developed infection can lead to significant leaf coverage, which reduces photosynthesis and may impact yield, especially if it occurs before pollination.",
        "recommendation": "*   **Plant Resistant Hybrids:** The most effective and economical long-term management strategy is to select and plant maize hybrids that have genetic resistance to Common Rust.\n*   **Scout Fields Regularly:** Monitor crops frequently, especially during periods of cool, humid weather (60-77\u00b0F or 16-25\u00b0C) which favors disease development. Early detection is key to determining if and when treatment is necessary.\n*   **Apply Foliar Fungicides:** If scouting reveals that the disease is progressing on susceptible hybrids near the critical tasseling growth stage, consider a timely application of a foliar fungicide. Products containing strobilurins (e.g., pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin) or triazoles are effective at controlling the disease and protecting yield potential.\n*   **Utilize Cultural Practices:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like soybeans or alfalfa and consider tillage to bury infected crop residue. This helps to reduce the amount of fungal inoculum that can survive and infect the following year's crop.",
