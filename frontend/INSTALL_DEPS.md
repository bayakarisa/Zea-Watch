# Install Dependencies

Run this command in the frontend directory to install all required packages:

```powershell
npm install
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```powershell
yarn install
```

This will install all the new Radix UI packages and other dependencies that were added to package.json.

After installation, restart your dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```
